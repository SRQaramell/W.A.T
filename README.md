Warzone Aerial Tactics is a realistic battlefield simulator in which the player assumes the role of a commander responsible for carrying out an operation to destroy an enemy base. Your task is to manage units and resources in real time, plan maneuvers, select appropriate equipment, and use communications infrastructure — all while fully accounting for environmental and logistical conditions.

Key Assumptions

The player must consider:

variable weather and terrain conditions (topography, vegetation cover, marshes, water obstacles),

UAV battery consumption and flight time, range, and the need to relocate relays/power supply payloads,

armor and durability of vehicles and the mobility limitations of heavy units,

planning the use of explosives and special charges (e.g., for breaching fortifications),

selection of antennas, relays, and communications networks to maintain command range,

use of and defense against jammers affecting communications and navigation.
